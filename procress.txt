Minimax at each depth play all possible moves,
once we reach max death. Call heuristic eval on current state of board- feature
extraction, put through neural network, outputs real number, and then propagates
up the tree.


Game n is being played:
  1. minimax creates tree
  2. if it reaches max depth
    3. call heuristic evaluation on current state of board and give a real number
    4. when real number is returned and that value propagates up
    5. make move from that number
Put game n through fitness function and return fitness score

Reinforcement learning vs. active learning is under unsupervised learning
-active- has an idea how it thinks and learns more about world
-Reinforcement- agent is learning how to learn
